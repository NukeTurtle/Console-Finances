## Instructions

I have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses.
My task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- [x] The total number of months included in the dataset.  
- [x] The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.  
- [x] The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.  
  - [x] I will need to track what the total change in profits is from month to month and then find the average.  
  - [x] (Total/Number of months)  
- [x] The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.  
- [x] The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.  


## Mock-Up

When I open my code in the browser my resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

```
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 25
Total: $2561231
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
```

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
